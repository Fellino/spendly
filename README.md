# Spendly

Spendly is a mobile application that I created as a study project of a real case application for me to use in Ireland (thats why the app is in EURO and the currency cannot be changed yet). Built with Ionic and Angular that helps users manage their finances by tracking transactions and categorizing expenses. Built with modern web technologies and mobile-first design.
